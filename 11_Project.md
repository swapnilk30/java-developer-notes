Server in company-
Development
When work starts, most developers will have development environments set up for the work. This is where they can build and verify the work they are doing. Developers use the development server to test code directly. This server is usually set up with the needed hardware, software and other necessary parts for debugging and deploying.

Test
Once the developers complete the work they will deploy that finished work to a test server. A test serverâ€™s set up and configurations will be for internal use by the team with necessary configurations. This allows the team to access the work for verification. They will create tasks for the developers or programmers to fix.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
When work passes through the internal testing phase and is ready for approvals, the team deploys it to a UAT server. Once in the server the work will get final client approvals.

This server will be set up in an environment that the client will be using. By doing this, a client will be able to access the product on this server. Along with being able to use it and see a real-time view of what the product will look like.

Production
Production servers are the final location for all finished and approved work. When you deploy code to a production server, this means everyone has approved it to go live.

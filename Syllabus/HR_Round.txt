What is your current Salary ?

Thank you for your offer but I will have to decline it.
I may have less experience ,but as per my research ,
a software developer is being paid between Rs. 9 and 11 for the similar role in your organisation,
And if I would too being the same job,I want to be paid fairly.

i dont want to join this organization ,feeling undervalued and then look for another job within a year or so.
So,
if you can offer me a reasonable offer ,I can consider this opportunity.

## MultiThreading
### What is Thread ?
    What are the different Thread states
- New State (Born)
- Runnable State (Ready)
- Running State (Execution)
- Waiting State (Blocked)
- Dead State (Exit)

### Why to override run() method while creating the thread using the Runnable interface ?
    because Runnable is interface and it has abstract method called run. 
    Hence when we implement the Runnable interface we have to override run() method. 

### Synchronization 


### Create an Object without ‘new’ Keyword
    Using Class.newInstance()

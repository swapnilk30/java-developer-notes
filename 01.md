## In a string, count the repeated characters and show in map using Java 8.
    For Example, "india" -> output is "i->2, n->1,d->1,a->1"

```java
public class CountChars {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		String str = "india";
		
		Map<Character, Long> charCounts = str.chars().mapToObj(c -> (char) c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(),Collectors.counting()));
		
		charCounts.forEach((k,v) -> System.out.print(k +" -> "+ v + " "));
		
	}
}
```

## Write a program to convert camel case string to snake case string.
    whatIsYourName -> WHAT_IS_YOUR_NAME
```java

public class CamelToSnakeCase {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		String str = "whatIsYourName";
		
		String snakeCase = convert(str);
		
		System.out.println(snakeCase);
	}

	private static String convert(String str) {
		
		String result = str.charAt(0)+"";
		
		int len = str.length();
		
		int i;
		
		for(i=1;i<len;i++) {
			if(Character.isUpperCase(str.charAt(i))) {
				result = result + "_" + str.charAt(i);
			}else {
				result = result + str.charAt(i);
			}	
		}
		return result.toUpperCase();
	}
}
```

Rama Physics 60 
Rama English 45 
Hari Math 70 
Hari Physics 65 
Hari English 85

Print the Students In Notice board format.
(i.e Calculate the Toal mark for an individual student, and print in descending order of total marks.)

```sql
-- Create the Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Subject VARCHAR(50),
    Marks INT
);

-- Insert data into the Student table
INSERT INTO Student (Name, Subject, Marks) VALUES
    ('Rama', 'Math', 50),
    ('Rama', 'Physics', 60),
    ('Rama', 'English', 45),
    ('Hari', 'Math', 70),
    ('Hari', 'Physics', 65),
    ('Hari', 'English', 85),
    ('Gita', 'Math', 90),
    ('Gita', 'Physics', 55),
    ('Gita', 'English', 80);

-- Calculate total marks for each student and sort them in descending order
SELECT Name, SUM(Marks) AS TotalMarks
FROM Student
GROUP BY Name
ORDER BY TotalMarks DESC;
```


## Given a sorted array arr[] of size N, the task is to remove the duplicate elements from the array.

    Examples: 

    Input: arr[] = {2, 2}
    Output: arr[] = {2,null}
    Explanation: All the elements are 2, So only keep one instance of 2.

    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4 }
    Output: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4,null,null}

## LinkedHashMap working principle

## Write a Java program to print a sequence of numbers up to N using 3 threads.
	For example, if
	we want to print a sequence of numbers up to 10 then itâ€™ll look like this: THREAD-1 : 1 THREAD-
	2 : 2 THREAD-3 : 3 THREAD-1 : 4 THREAD-2 : 5 THREAD-3 : 6 THREAD-1 : 7 THREAD-2 : 8
	THREAD-3 : 9 THREAD-1 : 10 using countdownlatch

## Output of a program student class saved in hashmap and equals , hashcode methods overriden.
```
Consider the following program to insert values into HashSet. 

class Student 
{ 	public int id; 
	public String name; 
	public Student(String name, int id){
		 this.name = name; this.id = id; 
	}
	public int hashCode() {
		 return this.id; 
	}
	
	public String toString() { 
		return "Student: " + this.name +"@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()); 
	} 
	
	public boolean equals(Object o) {
		 if (o instanceof Student) { Student s = (Student) o; return s.id == this.id ? true : false; } return false;
	}
 } 
		 
public class UpdateHashSet { 
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
HashSet<Student> studentList = new HashSet<>();
Student st1 = new Student("Nimit", 1);
Student st2 = new Student("Rahul", 3);
Student st3 = new Student("Nimit", 2); 
studentList.add(st1);
studentList.add(st2);
studentList.add(st3); 
System.out.println(studentList.size());
st1.id = 3;
System.out.println(studentList.size()); 
}
}
What will be the output?
```

## equals()
- it checks the equality of two objects.
- it compares the key, whether they are equal or not.
- it is a method of the Object Class. It can be Overridden.
- If you Override the equals() , then it is mandatory to override the hashCode().

## hashcode()
- This is the method of Object Class.
- It returns the hashcode value of the object in integer form.
- The value received from the method is used as bucket number(index).
- The bucket number (index) is the address of the element inside the map.
- HashCode of null Key is 0.

```
obj1.equals(obj2) is true
then 
obj1.hashCode() == obj2.hashCode() must be true.
if not they can be behave very weirdly.
```

## What is the contract between equals() and hashCode().
- if two objects are equal according to the equal() then the hashcode for both the objects must be same.
- it is not necessary that if we have same hashcode for two objects which means those two objects are equal.(This is collision. Better hash function can prevent this.)
- when ever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of java application,the hashcode method must consistently return the same integer.

## Internal Working of HashMap.
1. When we initialize a HashMap , the bucket or Array is initialized.
2. When we call put(key,value) method to insert the content.
3. It will first check whether the key is null or not, if the key is null it calls putForNullKey() which returns index 0, which is always reserved for null key, hashcode for null is zero.
4. if key is not null then it calculates the hashcode of key.
5. After calculation the hashcode of the key , it calls indexfor() by passing the hashcode of the key and length of the table array.
- this method returns the index of the array for that particular key value pair.
- index  = hashCode(key) & (n-1).
6. **After getting the index** , it checks all key present in the linked list at that index using **equals()** if the key is already present in the linked list it **replaces the old value with new value**.
7. if the key is not present in the linked list it appends the specified key value pair at the end of the linked list
8. when the calculated index value is same for two or more keys the collision is resolved by linked list the entry class has an attribute next this attribute always points to the next object in the chain.


## Internal Working of HashSet.

## Why String is immutable.
- Security : strings are used in java for classloders and immutability provides security that coreect class is being loaded by the classloader.
- Performance : String pool is possible only because string is immutable in java. this way java runtime saves a lot of heap memory because different string variables can refers to the same String variables.
- MultiThreading : it is always safe for multithreading .this avoid the use of synchronization for thread safety.
- Keys : 

## How To Create immutable class.
	Student{
		id,name,List<String> hobbies;
	}
	Employee{
		id,name,Addresss address;
	}
	Address{
		city
	}

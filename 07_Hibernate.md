## Why we need maven
- No need to add jar files manually.
- We can directly add the dependency.

## What is Hibernate?
- Hibernate is an open-source and lightweight ORM tool that is used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data from the database.

## What is ORM?
- ORM is an acronym for Object/Relational mapping. It is a programming strategy to map object with the data stored in the database. It simplifies data creation, data manipulation, and data access.
## Explain hibernate architecture?
## What are the core interfaces of Hibernate?
```
The core interfaces of Hibernate framework are:

Configuration
SessionFactory
Session
Query
Criteria
Transaction
```
## Mention some of the advantages of using ORM over JDBC.
```
ORM has the following advantages over JDBC:

Application development is fast.
Management of transaction.
Generates key automatically.
Details of SQL queries are hidden.
```
## Define criteria in terms of Hibernate.
```
The objects of criteria are used for the creation and execution of the object-oriented criteria queries.
```
## List some of the databases supported by Hibernate.
```
Some of the databases supported by Hibernate are:

DB2
MySQL
Oracle
Sybase SQL Server
Informix Dynamic Server
HSQL
PostgreSQL
FrontBase
```
## List the key components of Hibernate.
```
Key components of Hibernate are:

Configuration
Session
SessionFactory
Criteria
Query
Transaction
```
## Mention two components of Hibernate configuration object.
```
Database Connection

Class Mapping Setup

## How is SQL query created in Hibernate?
```
The SQL query is created with the help of the following syntax:

Session.createSQLQuery
```
## What does HQL stand for?
```
Hibernate Query Language
```
## How is HQL query created?
```
The HQL query is created with the help of the following syntax:

Session.createQuery
```
## How can we add criteria to a SQL query?
```
A criterion is added to a SQL query by using the Session.createCriteria.
```
## Define persistent classes.
```
Classes whose objects are stored in a database table are called as persistent classes.
```
## What is persistence?

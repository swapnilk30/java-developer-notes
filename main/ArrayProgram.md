# Examples:
```java

String str1 = "hello";

String str2 = new String("hello");

String[] stringArray = { "apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "strawberry" };

int[] intArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

List<Integer> listOfIntger = Arrays.asList();

List<String> listOfString = Arrays.asList();

List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList();

## Split an array into chunks with a specified size.
Example - array = [1,2,3,4,5] chunkSize = 1 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] chunkSize = 2 [1, 2] [3, 4] [5] chunkSize = 3 [1, 2, 3] [4, 5] chunkSize = 4 [1, 2, 3, 4] [5] chunkSize = 5 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] chunkSize = 6 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This is a problem around OO design Ask the candidate to start a new code snippet in onlingdb. Once the questions are done, make sure the code snippet is put in the feedback comments. You have to design a solution (classes, interfaces, etc etc) for DeckofCards. Each card has a suit (heart, spade, club, diamond) and a rank (ace, king, queen jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). Problem 1 Write a function to Compare two cards and return bigger one. Suit doesnt matter. Problem 2 You are given a shuffled deck of cards. You have to sort them (by suit and then by rank) 

Flatten nested arrays in java. 1. Numbers or nested arrays can be upto n levels. 2. Recursive approach - Good to know Code Template - https://onlinegdb.com/O1TZTwvHT Ensure the candidate fork is given the detailed feedback Ensure the candidate output is copy pasted into the detailed feedback Example Input -> [[[1],2],[3,4]] Output -> [1,2,3,4]

Can one use an Employee class as a key in a HashMap?

Employee Table -- Id -- Name -- Salary -- Department id Find one employee from each department who is getting the highest salary within his department. Discuss further on server side pagination, boundary cases like 2 emp getting the same salary in the same department which is highest etc.

Consider a class A with a synchronized method class A { public void synchronized m1() {Thread.sleep(5000);} } We create two objects of this class - o1 and o2. We call o1.m1() on one thread and o2.m1() on another thread, at the same time. What will be the behaviour? Follow up with - how will you force these calls to execute one after the other

1. Basics of Hashmap. How hashmap will work for below scenario:
hashmap.put(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 200);
hashmap.put(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 400);
hashmap.get(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 200);

For same question, 2 scenarios 
1. What if equals method is overridden and hashcode is not
2. ⁠and vice versa

Tip: very core and basic understanding of collections is expected

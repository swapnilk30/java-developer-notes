Wissen-mumbai: Program 1:

- Find the first non repetitive character in a string

Program 2:
Print a list of integers without using any loop, foreach method or streamAPI.
------------
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> integers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        printList(integers, 0);
    }

    public static void printList(List<Integer> list, int index) {
        if (index < list.size()) {
            System.out.println(list.get(index));
            printList(list, index + 1);
        }
    }

Given fews places like mumbai pune bangalore Mysore chennai
There are routes from 
Bangalore to Mysore
Mysore to Chennai
Chennai to Mumbai
Mumbai to Bangalore
I want to know whether i can go from 1 place to another with the help of these routes


This is basically the Breadth firdt search algorithm in graphs or tress


[4:09 pm, 13/03/2024] Wissen-mumbai: Theoretical:

1. Basics of Hashmap. How hashmap will work for below scenario:
hashmap.put(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 200);
hashmap.put(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 400);
hashmap.get(new Employee(1,”sumant”), 200);

For same question, 2 scenarios 
1. What if equals method is overridden and hashcode is not

- So again Duplicate keys are allowed.
Reason -> If Only equals() is overriden , then when you call map.put(firstKey,someValue) firstKey will hash to some bucket and 
when you call ma.put(secondKey,someValue) it will hash to some other bucket.(as they have a different hashCode)
So , althouugh they are equal . as they dont hash to the same bucket
the map cant realize it 

2. ⁠and vice versa

Tip: very core and basic understanding of collections is expected

Java 8 features questions  to code
Run time polymorphism question to code
Java8 stream related questions mainly regarding sorting

1. What is a microservice architecture?
- It is an architecture to develop complex applications.
- These built as a collection of small, independent services.
- These Services communicate with each other through APIs.
- It will enable modular and decoupled systems.

2. What are the benefits of using a microservices architecture?
- Microservices architecture offers benefits such as
- Scalability (Scale Up/Down and Scale In/Out)
- Resilience (Reduce Cascading Failures)
- Flexibility, faster development cycles.
- Easier maintenance due to its modular and independent nature.

3. Explain SOLID Principle? 
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility or job.
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for 
modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of its subclasses without breaking the behavior of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Creation of smaller, more cohesive interfaces instead of large ones that cover multiple scenarios.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle encourages the use of interfaces and dependency 
injection to decouple modules and make them more reusable and testable.

4. What is Cloud, and what are its key features? 
- Spring Cloud is a framework built on top of Spring Boot.
- Used for development and deployment of microservices
- Key features: service discovery and registration, load balancing, circuit breaking, distributed configuration, API gateway, and distributed tracing.

5. it achieved in Spring Cloud? 
- The process of dynamically locating and communicating with services.
- In Spring Cloud, service discovery is achieved using Netflix Eureka or Consul.
- services to register themselves and discover other services, enabling communication between 
microservices.

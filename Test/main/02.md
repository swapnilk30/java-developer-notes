# CORE JAVA

## Type Of Application :
- Standalone application -> desktop application,which need to be installed on desktop.
- Web Application -> application which are made to run on internet via server connection with dynamic web pages support
- Enterprice Application -> distributed in nature
- Mobile Application -> created for mobile devices.


## Variables

- Global Variables
- Local Variables

## Methods
    Method is a block of statement that are used to perform some task(action).

- static method
- non-static method

### why do we need method ?
- they provide behavior to object of a class.
- methods provide reusability feature.

## Operators 
    operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators
- Relational operators
- Assignment operators
- Bitwise operators
- Unary operators
- Ternary operators
- Shift operators
- New operator
- Dot operator
- InstanceOf operators


## Access Modifiers
## static
## Constructor

## Encapsulation

- Binding of data into a single entity(class) is called as encapsulation.
- In Other words it is a programming technique that binds the class members (Variable + methods) together and prevent them from direct access.
- Every java class is an example of encapsulation.

## Inheritance

- Inheritance is creating a new class from the existing class functionality.
- it means reusability.
- it shows `IS-A` relationship.

```java

class Product {
    String name;
    double price;

    public Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

class ElectronicProduct extends Product {
    String brand;

    public ElectronicProduct(String name, double price, String brand) {
        super(name, price);
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}

class ClothingProduct extends Product {
    String size;

    public ClothingProduct(String name, double price, String size) {
        super(name, price);
        this.size = size;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElectronicProduct iphone = new ElectronicProduct("iPhone 13", 999.0, "Apple");
        ClothingProduct tshirt = new ClothingProduct("Striped T-shirt", 29.99, "M");

        System.out.println("Electronic product: " + iphone.name + " - " + iphone.brand + " - $" + iphone.price);
        System.out.println("Clothing product: " + tshirt.name + " - " + tshirt.size + " - $" + tshirt.price);
    }
}

```

## Polymorphism
## Abstraction

### Why do we need Marker Interface ?
- Marker Interface is an interface with no abstract method.(empty interface)
- It is also known as a tagging interface and is used to indicate or inform the JVM that a class implementing this interface will have some special behavior.
- Example : Serializable, Cloneable, and Remote Interfaces

## Object class
## final 
## this and super
## Exception Handling
## Serialization
## Array

---

## String
### String class methods
- char charAt(int index)
- static String format(String format, Object... args)
- String substring(int beginIndex)
- String concat(String str)
- String[] split(String regex)
- static String valueOf(int value)
- String trim()


### Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
### Why Strings are Immutable or final in Java ?


### How to create immutable class.

## MultiThreading

### Realtime Example of Multithreading ?

### What is Thread ?
    What are the different Thread states
- New State (Born)
- Runnable State (Ready)
- Running State (Execution)
- Waiting State (Blocked)
- Dead State (Exit)







### Synchronization



### Create an Object without ‘new’ Keyword
    Using Class.newInstance()

## Input and Output Stream (java.io package)
- Stream : In Java , streams are the sequence of data that are read from the source and written to the destination.
1. Input and 
2. Output
- We can perform **File Handling** in java by java I/O API.
- IOException , FileNotFoundException-> fully checked exception

- Type of streams :
1. Byte Stream
- Input Stream - read()
> This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes. It's designed to read data from various sources.Some common subclasses include FileInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, and BufferedInputStream.
- Output Stream - write()
> This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing an output stream of bytes. It's designed to write data to various destinations. Some common subclasses include FileOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, and BufferedOutputStream.
2. Character Stream
- Reader
- Writer
3. Object
